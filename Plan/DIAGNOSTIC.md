## How Scoring Works (The Weighted Spectrum)

Instead of a simple 1-to-1 mapping, this system uses weighted influence to make results more nuanced and harder to predict.

1. **User answers 8 questions.**
2. Each answer distributes points to three different personas:
   - **Primary (+3 pts):** The core motivation.
   - **Secondary (+2 pts):** The secondary trait.
   - **Tertiary (+1 pt):** The subtle shadow trait.
3. Total scores are tallied for all 10 IDs (p1 through p10).
4. The Persona with the highest aggregate score wins.
5. **Tie-breaker Priority:** p1 > p2 > p3 > p4 > p5 > p6 > p7 > p8 > p9 > p10.
