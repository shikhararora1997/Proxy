# PROXY - Install Guide

## What is this?

PROXY can be installed on your phone like a regular app, but without going through the App Store. This is called a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**.

### Is it safe?

**Yes, completely safe.** A PWA:
- Cannot access your contacts, photos, files, or other apps
- Cannot run secretly in the background
- Cannot install anything on your phone
- Is sandboxed by your browser - isolated from everything else

It's essentially a bookmark that opens in full-screen mode with the ability to send you helpful reminders.

## How to Install

### iPhone / iPad (iOS)

1. **Open PROXY in Safari**
   - Go to `your-proxy-url.vercel.app` in Safari
   - Must be Safari (Chrome/Firefox won't work on iOS)

2. **Tap the Share button**
   - It's the square with an arrow pointing up (bottom of screen)

3. **Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"**

4. **Tap "Add" in the top right**

5. **Open PROXY from your home screen**
   - Find the PROXY icon on your home screen
   - Tap it to open

6. **Enable Notifications** (important!)
   - When prompted, tap "Allow" to receive task reminders
   - If you missed it: Settings > PROXY > Notifications > Allow

**Note:** On iOS, PROXY must be opened from the home screen icon to receive notifications. Opening it in Safari won't work for notifications.

## What Notifications Will I Get?

PROXY sends you a gentle reminder every 4 hours with your pending task summary:

> "You have 2 high priority and 3 low priority tasks pending"

Tapping the notification opens PROXY so you can review and manage your tasks.

**That's it.** No spam, no marketing - just helpful reminders about tasks you created.

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm not getting notifications"

**iOS:**
- Make sure you opened PROXY from the home screen icon (not Safari)
- Check Settings > PROXY > Notifications is enabled
- Make sure you're on iOS 16.4 or later

**Android:**
- Check the app's notification settings
- Make sure battery optimization isn't blocking PROXY

### "The app looks weird / doesn't load"

- Try closing and reopening from the home screen
- Clear browser cache and reinstall to home screen

### "I want to uninstall"

- Just delete the icon like any other app
- On iOS: Long-press > Remove App
- On Android: Long-press > Uninstall
